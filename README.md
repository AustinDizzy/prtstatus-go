PRT Status server on Go
=====

This repository hosts the server componentry for the Android application I made to monitor [West Virginia University](https://wvu.edu)'s [PRT](https://transportation.wvu.edu/prt) uptime status.


You may find the Android application's repo [here](https://github.com/AustinDizzy/prtstatus-android).


Feel free to submit issues, pull requests, and enhancements as necessary. This is about as barebones and least server/resource intensive as possible. All other features (e.g. blacklist notification scheduling) are to be done client side on the Android application itself.
