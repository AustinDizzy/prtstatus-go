        You will now be receiving pushes to your Pushbullet account when there is a PRT status update.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a test, we've went ahead and sent you the current PRT status. If you did not receive it, please go back and try again. <br>
        If you do not receive any updates, try joining the channel: <a class="pushbullet-subscribe-widget" data-channel="wvuprtstatus" data-widget="button" data-size="small"></a>
<script type="text/javascript">(function(){var a=document.createElement('script');a.type='text/javascript';a.async=true;a.src='https://widget.pushbullet.com/embed.js';var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b);})();</script>. If this still doesn't work, please contact me.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Be warned, if you are a member of the Pushbullet channel and you have gone through the subsequent prompts to add your account, you may be notified twice for each update. Leave the channel if this happens.
